Dashboard Description: Splunk Internal Monitoring Dashboard
The Splunk Internal Monitoring Dashboard provides centralized visibility into Splunk’s internal system logs to support proactive monitoring, performance analysis, and anomaly detection. The dashboard analyzes events from the _internal index to present key operational metrics through multiple visualizations.

It includes severity-based log distribution to identify abnormal error patterns, time-based event trend analysis to detect spikes or irregular activity, component-level insights to pinpoint high-log-generating services, and a KPI-style single-value panel to track overall system activity. Together, these panels enable quick situational awareness, efficient troubleshooting, and SOC-style monitoring of system health.

This dashboard demonstrates practical expertise in SPL querying, log analysis, and visualization design, aligning with real-world security operations center (SOC) monitoring workflows.
